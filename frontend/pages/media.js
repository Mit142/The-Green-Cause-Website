    title: "2025 Seeds of Caring's Kids as Planet Protectors: An Earth Day Celebration",
    description: `Green Cause was thrilled to be a part of the 2025 Seeds of Caring's Kids as Planet Protectors, an inspiring and collaborative Earth Day celebration that welcomed nearly 600 kids and grown-ups to join forces to bring KIND to the Earth.

At our interactive community booth, young changemakers got hands-on with sustainability‚Äîdecorating reusable snack bags and learning through a sorting game how simple swaps like plastic vs glass straws or paper napkins vs reusable towels can make a difference.

Kids explored earth-friendly items like beeswax wraps, dryer balls, and plantable seed paper, and left with a sense of curiosity and responsibility. We can‚Äôt wait to return next year!`,

    title: "üåø Empowering the Next Generation: Sustainable Living at Brooklyn Prospect Sunset Yards",
    description: `One of our lead coordinators, Sonia Garg, led three sustainability workshops at Brooklyn Charter schools, engaging students in an immersive experience on how to live more consciously and care for our planet and health. 

Through an interactive presentation, students explored the reality of climate change, consequences of waste, and importance of everyday choices‚Äîfrom reducing plastic use to supporting sustainable diets. They learned how small habits, like using reusable bags, eating seasonal produce, conserving water, and air-drying clothes, can make a powerful impact.

We wrapped up the day by designing posters for recycling, composting, and trash to help students visually understand how to sort waste responsibly. It is always a pleasure to inspire curiosity and commitment towards a sustainable future. We are excited to continue our work for a greener future, one classroom at a time.`,
