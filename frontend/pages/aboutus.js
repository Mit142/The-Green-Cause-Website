                            The Green Cause was founded by Frida Ruiz and Bianca Palomino.
                            When Frida noticed the lack of environmental education in her town,
                            she aimed to provide young people with the knowledge necessary to spark urgency for the future.
                            Bianca resonated with this mission, realizing that her town also lacked environmental
                            awareness in public education.

                            During the peak of the pandemic, Frida and Bianca worked to recruit members and
                            connect with schoolsâ€”first within their counties, then expanding across New Jersey.
                            They also presented at panels advocating for youth leadership and environmental change.
