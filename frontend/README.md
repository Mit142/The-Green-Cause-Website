# The Green Cause Frontend
### How to begin frontend development:

First, install NodeJS from its respective site. 

To begin frontend development, you must first install all packages that come with the project.
```bash
npm i
```

Once all the packages are done downloading, you're ready to start the server
To start the server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs a server locally on localhost:3000 where the website is accessible.
From here, you can begin development. If you're ever confused, contact me.
