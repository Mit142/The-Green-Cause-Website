# The-Green-Cause-Website
### Welcome to The Green Cause's website project!

In this repo we have two main folders:
Frontend
Backend

These folders contain the web interface and the server respectively.
The frontend is in NextJS (Javascript) and the backend is in Flask (Python).

In each folder will contain instructions on how to setup the dev environment.

I look forward to working with you all!
