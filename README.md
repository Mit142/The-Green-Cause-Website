# 🌿 The Green Cause Website

## 🌍 Welcome to The Green Cause's website project!

We're thrilled to have you on board as we work together to create a fantastic online platform for The Green Cause. In this repository, you'll find two main folders that will guide you through the development process:

### 🔮 Frontend
This folder houses the web interface built using Next.js (JavaScript). It's where we craft the user-facing magic!

### 🛠️ Backend
This folder is home to our server, which is powered by Flask (Python). Here, we handle the behind-the-scenes work that brings our platform to life.

Each folder contains detailed instructions on setting up the development environment, so you can jump right into contributing.

💡 We're excited to collaborate and see the incredible work you'll bring to The Green Cause Website!
